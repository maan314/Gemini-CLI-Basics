# Geoffrey Hinton

## The Godfather of AI

Geoffrey Everest Hinton (born 6 December 1947) is a British-Canadian cognitive psychologist and computer scientist, most noted for his work on artificial neural networks. He is a Turing Award laureate, along with Yoshua Bengio and Yann LeCun, for their work on deep learning.

He was a co-author of a highly cited paper published in 1986 that popularized the backpropagation algorithm for training multi-layer neural networks. He is also a major figure in the deep learning community.

In 2023, he publicly announced his departure from Google, citing concerns about the potential risks of AI.

## Famous Quotes

> "Computers will understand sarcasm before Americans do."

> "In the long run, curiosity-driven research just works better... Real breakthroughs come from people focusing on what they're excited about."

> "In A.I., the holy grail was how do you generate internal representations."

> "I am scared that if you make the technology work better, you help the NSA misuse it more. I'd be more worried about that than about autonomous killer robots."

> "Everybody right now, they look at the current technology, and they think, 'OK, that's what artificial neural nets are.' And they don't realize how arbitrary it is. We just made it up! And there's no reason why we shouldn't make up something else."

> "In a sensibly organised society, if you improve productivity, there is room for everybody to benefit. The problem isn't the technology, but the way the benefits are shared out."

> "I refuse to say whether I believe machines can think or not, because I think it's a stupid question."

> "Some people worry that computers will get too smart and take over the world. I think the real worry is that computers will get too smart and discover that we're not very interesting."

> "AI trained by good people will have a bias towards good; AI trained by bad people such as Putin or somebody like that will have a bias towards bad. We know they're going to make battle robots. They're not going to necessarily be good since their primary purpose is going to be to kill people."
